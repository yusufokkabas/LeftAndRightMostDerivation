## Programming Languages Homework done by @tarikcanavar and me.

### This is a python script for left and right most derivation. Program takes three inputs. First is “ll.txt” which contains LL(1) parsing table for left most derivation. Second is “lr.txt” which contains LR(1) parsing table for right most derivation. Third is “input.txt” which contains input strings (could be more than 2) program should process with their corresponding tables.
