# LeftAndRightMostDerivation
Programming Languages Homework done by @tarikcanavar and me.

In this assignment, you are asked to write a Python program for left and right most derivation. For this purpose, your program should take three inputs. First is “ll.txt” which contains LL(1) parsing table for left most derivation. Second is “lr.txt” which contains LR(1) parsing table for right most derivation. Third is “input.txt” which contains input strings (could be more than 2) you should process with their corresponding tables. You should use the following variables to store file names.
FILE_LL = “ll.txt”
FILE_LR = “lr.txt”
FILE_INPUT = “input.txt”
# These variables contains names of the files you must read. Their default value should be the values given here, not different or personalized. In addition, you should NOT use global addressing for these files (e.g. C:\user\student\Desktop\input.txt). You should only use their names so that they are searched on local folder only.
